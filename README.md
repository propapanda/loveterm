> Simple 1-bit tiled graphics for [Love2d](https://love2d.org/)

# I would highly recommend not using this in its current state.

LoveTerm is a small library for drawing tiled greyscaled images with 
foreground and background colors. Its main intended use is to emulate
terminal graphics and semigraphics from the comfort of Love2d and Lua
for roguelike games, but it could be useful for other retro style games.

The included tilesets follow Code Page 437, but you could use any images
you want. However, `loveterm.print` expects the ASCII codes to match
their respective characters in the tileset. For example, `48` is 0, `65`
is A, etc.

Contributions of more public domain tilesets or color palettes are very
welcome!
